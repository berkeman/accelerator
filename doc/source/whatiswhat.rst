Basic Terminology and Operation
===============================

Exax is designed to be

 - fast, for two main reasons:
   - it will re-use earlier computations to save execution time
   - it is very easy to write simple but very powerful parallel programs.

 - transparent and reproducible
   - straightforward to validate that a specific output ...
   - there is a connection between produced output to source code and input data.
   - no need for intermediate filenames
   - An unchanged program will re-run in a fraction of a second.




All source code in a project is separated into two types of files,
*build scripts* and *methods*.  While a build scripts is the "glue"
that controls execution on a higher level, methods are designed for
the core computations.
